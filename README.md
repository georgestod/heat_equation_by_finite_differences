# Solving the linear heat equation by finite differences

Matlab code to simulate the linear heat equation,

$ u_t = \alpha \cdot \nabla^2 u $

by finite differences. The shared implementation is a 2D one, but can be easily extended to the 3D case.
Just have a look at the (beautiful) pdf attached PDF details.
